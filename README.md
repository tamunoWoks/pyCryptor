# pyCryptor

## Overview

`pyCryptor` is a simple yet powerful command-line encryption and decryption tool written in Python. It supports multiple encryption techniques to secure your messages, such as the **Caesar Cipher**, **Substitution Cipher**, and **Vigenère Cipher**. Whether you're encrypting messages for fun or learning about cryptographic algorithms, `pyCryptor` is an excellent choice to explore the basics of encryption.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple shift-based cipher. Supports letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Substitution Cipher**: Replace each character with a predefined substitution for secure encryption.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Use a keyword to perform complex encryption and decryption.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A menu-driven program that is easy to navigate.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system with Python installed.

## How It Works
### 1. Caesar Cipher
A basic shift cipher where each letter is shifted by a user-defined number of positions in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved.

### 2. Substitution Cipher
Each letter is replaced by a corresponding character based on a predefined mapping. This method provides stronger encryption compared to Caesar Cipher.

### 3. Vigenère Cipher
A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter in the message, making it harder to crack.
